# Software-Development-Skills-Front-End-2023
## Learning Diary

Date: May 10th, 2023

Today was a productive day of learning as I delved into the world of web development. I started by setting up my coding environment, which was not unfamiliar territory, but I appreciated the link to discover a couple of new extensions in VS Code I found useful. I got everything up and running smoothly.

Next, I began reminding myself about Sass, but I was shocked by the video when I saw Traversy Media setting up Node-Sass manually. I've always used the Live Sass Compiler extension in VS Code, and I appreciated the insight on how I could set up the compiler manually. I'll appreciate the practice, as for the most part my experience with Sass has been using it as a means of organizing pieces of styling in partials.

So I'm continuing my journey to becoming a web developer. I feel more confident in my ability to set up a development environment, and use Sass to write more efficient CSS. I look forward to continuing to learn and grow in this exciting field.
